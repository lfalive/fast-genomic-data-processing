* [boost](https://www.boost.org/) : Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries.
* [libtorch](https://pytorch.org/) : An open source machine learning framework that accelerates the path from research prototyping to production deployment.

### Building Mutect2Cpp-master

build the code from a Git repository
requires extra steps:

```sh

```

By default, this will build against an HTSlib source tree in `../htslib`.
this program need libtorch in `/usr/libtorch` to run.
